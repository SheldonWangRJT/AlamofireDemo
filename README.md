# AlamofireDemo

Hello there, this is Sheldon again.

Today I will talk about JSON downloading / image downloading with progress bar with the help of Alamofire.

Alamofire is a widely used third party SDK that can help developer do multiple downloading jobs. The official github link for Alamofire is:
https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire

In the video tutorial, I used two features of Alamofire, downloading JSON and downloading image with progress bar. The final video tutorial in Youtube is:
